Logic: The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Here's how it works:
Start with 0 and 1.
Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
The logic looks like this:
f(0) = 0
f(1) = 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n â‰¥ 2
Examples:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...


def fibonacci(n):
    f0, f1 = 0, 1
    result = [f0, f1]
    
    for _ in range(2, n):
        next_term = f0 + f1
        result.append(next_term)
        f0, f1 = f1, next_term
    
    return result

n = int(input("Enter any number: "))
fibonacci_series = fibonacci(n)
print(fibonacci_series)
